# SQL Access:-
---

Elasticsearch SQL aims to provide a powerful yet lightweight SQL interface to Elasticsearch.if you want more information about this to follow this link <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/sql-overview.html>

Elasticsearch SQL:-
---

To start using Elasticsearch SQL, create an index with some data:

PUT /library/book/_bulk?refresh
{"index":{"_id": "Leviathan Wakes"}}
{"name": "Leviathan Wakes", "author": "James S.A. Corey", "release_date": "2011-06-02", "page_count": 561}
{"index":{"_id": "Hyperion"}}
{"name": "Hyperion", "author": "Dan Simmons", "release_date": "1989-05-26", "page_count": 482}
{"index":{"_id": "Dune"}}
{"name": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert", "release_date": "1965-06-01", "page_count": 604}

And now you can execute SQL using the SQL REST API right away:

how to produce output like table:-
---

POST /_xpack/sql?format=txt
{
    "query": "SELECT * FROM library WHERE release_date < '2000-01-01'"
}

Which should return something along the lines of:

    author     |     name      |  page_count   | release_date
---------------+---------------+---------------+------------------------
Dan Simmons    |Hyperion       |482            |1989-05-26T00:00:00.000Z
Frank Herbert  |Dune           |604            |1965-06-01T00:00:00.000Z

how to produce output like json:-
---

POST /_xpack/sql?format=json
{
    "query": "SELECT * FROM library WHERE release_date < '2000-01-01'"
}

Which should return something like this:

{
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "author",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "name",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "page_count",
      "type": "long"
    },
    {
      "name": "release_date",
      "type": "date"
    }
  ],
  "rows": [
    [
      "Dan Simmons",
      "Hyperion",
      482,
      "1989-05-26T00:00:00.000Z"
    ],
    [
      "Frank Herbert",
      "Dune",
      604,
      "1965-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    ]
  ]
}

You can also use the SQL CLI. There is a script to start it shipped in x-packâ€™s bin directory:

$ ./bin/elasticsearch-sql-cli
From there you can run the same query:

sql> SELECT * FROM library WHERE release_date < '2000-01-01';
    author     |     name      |  page_count   | release_date
---------------+---------------+---------------+------------------------
Dan Simmons    |Hyperion       |482            |1989-05-26T00:00:00.000Z
Frank Herbert  |Dune           |604            |1965-06-01T00:00:00.000Z

### Extract
---

As an alternative, one can support EXTRACT to extract fields from datetimes. You can run any datetime function with EXTRACT(<datetime_function> FROM <expression>). So

POST /_xpack/sql?format=txt
{
    "query": "SELECT EXTRACT(DAY_OF_YEAR FROM CAST('2018-02-19T10:23:27Z' AS TIMESTAMP)) AS day"
}

      day
---------------
50

is the equivalent to


POST /_xpack/sql?format=txt
{
    "query": "SELECT DAY_OF_YEAR(CAST('2018-02-19T10:23:27Z' AS TIMESTAMP)) AS day"
}

      day
